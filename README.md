# Dicee
Made with Swift - Storyboard

## About the app
This app was originally from an iOS 13 Udemy Course. It simple had 2 dices and a roll buttom, that, when clicked, the dices would roll.

I had my own ideas for it and improved the app.
* The user can choose different types of dices
* The user can choose how many dices to be rolled (from 1 to 4)
